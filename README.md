Hi Everyone,

This is another projected made by me and it is based on webscrapping and Power BI. 

I am very fond of cricket and recenetly, cricket world cup 2024 has been concluded. I couldn't resist myself from create a project on this and after a lot of thinking and exploration, I thought of creating a power bi report inorder to check stats and patterns in T20 world cup. This project had two parts

1. Webscrapping and preprocessing the webscraped data.
2. Using the data for power bi reports

In webscrapping, 

I have scraped the data of match details, bowling scorecards, batting scorecards and player information from the Espncricinfo website using Scrapy.

I have also used scrapy to scrape the images of all the players and logos of all the teams from the icc-cricket website.

After these steps, I preprocessed the scraped data in more usable form and then loaded the data in Power BI.


Here is the link to the dataset : <a> https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/codingmukul/t20-world-cup-2024-data </a>

In this report, on the primary level there are three sections.

1. Individual Player Analysis: Here, one can see the bowling and batting performance of any player with all the stats throughout the season.

2. Top Performers: It shows the list of top performers in different categories i.e. Power Hitters, Anchors, Finishers, All rounders, and bowlers. 

3. Other stats: It includes the other stats like player of the match awards, number of winnings while batting first or bowling first and number of toss wins.
